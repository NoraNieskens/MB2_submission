Title          : Analyse Tree species composition with time-series multispectral data  
Purpose        : This Script is written as a final project for the Programming and Geostatistical Analysis course (Eagle master programm, teacher Dr. Martin Wegmann     
Author         : Nora Nieskens 
Data           : Field data: Vascular plant species identity and their cover on each plot for Steigerwald and Uniforest (Source: ), Landcover raster based on Sentinel2 from 2016 (Source: mundialis GmbH & Co. KG)             
                 Satellite data : Sentinel 2 data 2017: multi-temporal composite (will be generated in the script)
Output         : Spatial predicition of community composition (NDMS1, NDMS2) and species richness
